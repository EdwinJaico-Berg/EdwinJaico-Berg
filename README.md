Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am @EdwinJaico-Berg and am particularly interested in data science, Python, and (learning) C++.

On my GitHub profile, you will find a variety of projects that showcase my skills and interests. For example, I have worked on data science projects using Python and its popular libraries, such as pandas, scikit-learn, and PyTorch. I have also created some small C++ projects, such as a calculator, and Python projects using Dash, Flask, and other libraries.

I am always looking to learn and improve my skills, so I am open to suggestions and feedback on my projects. If you have any ideas for new projects or suggestions for how I can improve my existing projects, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. I hope you find my projects interesting and I look forward to collaborating with you in the future!
